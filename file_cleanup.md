# File Cleanup Instructions

To fix the compilation errors, please make sure only one implementation of the service exists. 

## Files to Keep
- `c:\Users\bumee\Downloads\Fraud-Alert-LK\fraudbackend\service.bal` (the main implementation we've been working on)

## Files to Delete
- `c:\Users\bumee\Downloads\Fraud-Alert-LK\fraudbackend\service_new.bal` (causing redeclaration errors)
- `c:\Users\bumee\Downloads\Fraud-Alert-LK\fraudbackend\service_simplified.bal` (causing redeclaration errors)

These files are causing "redeclared symbol" errors because they're declaring the same configurable variables, types, and functions that already exist in the main service.bal file.
